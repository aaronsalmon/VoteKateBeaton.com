### Endorse Kate Beaton for City Council

I've had the pleasure of serving our great city for the last 3 years as an at-large member of the Eau Claire City Council. In that time we've done amazing things together to make our city more functional, fun, and fair. I'm asking for another 3 years to serve you.

YOU are what I love most about our city. It's what makes it magical and loving and powerful. Your endorsement means the world to me. And it means the world to the voters of Eau Claire as you validate your support for me and the values that we share--fairness, integrity, and equity.
