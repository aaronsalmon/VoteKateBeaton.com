### Endorse Kate Beaton for City Council

Eau Claireâ€™s magic comes from its people. The people are what I love most about this city. Thank you to those who have endorsed my campaign and our shared values--a community where all can thrive, a clean energy future for our children, an open democracy.

#### I am proud to support my good friend Kate Beaton in her re-election bid for the Eau Claire City Council. Kate works tirelessly for the residents of our city. I am very thankful for her leadership in supporting the lead pipe replacement program which ensures that all children in our city have access to clean drinking water. Kate has taken this work even further by serving as a visible advocate with state legislators regarding safe drinking water protections for kids and families. This is just one example of the practical solutions that Kate supports and makes a reality as a city leader.

#### Kate has been an inspiring leader for me and many of my neighbors in Eau Claire, and one of the reasons why I decided to run for city council myself!

#### I believe in having diversity of races, genders and ages included in a body that  represents and makes decisions for the citizens of this city. For me Kate Beaton brings a perspective from her generation to the role on the City Council. I have watched Kate grow as an elected official and also in the important role of relationship building--always "showing up" for issues that address her constituents and this city. We are fortunate to have her serving and I look forward to continuing to work with Kate.

#### I've had the good fortune to know and work with Kate for several years. Kate has her heart in the right place and has proven to be willing to do what it takes to do the right thing for our community. Though, I don't live within the city limits of Eau Claire, I have lived and worked in or near Eau Claire my entire life. It is clearly important to me and my family that the most competent and progressive people are elected to make policy decisions that make Eau Claire a leader in our state. Kate Beaton stands out as someone I can trust to take that task seriously and keep Eau Claire moving forward.
