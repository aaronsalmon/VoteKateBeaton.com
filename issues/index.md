### I <3 Eau Claire

<img src="/img/Eau_Claire_outline.png" class="pull-right img-right">I love Eau Claire. I fell in love with Eau Claire when I arrived to attend the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and I can’t imagine calling any other place home. Not only does Eau Claire have so much going for it including Phoenix Park, the historic Downtown area, and the rich music scene, there are so many more amazing things to come including the Confluence Project and the year round public market. 

As great as Eau Claire is, I want to help make it even better. There are some things that we are doing as a community that I think we could do better and there are some serious issues we need to start to address. 

Please see my list of issues and ideas below. 


#### Public transportation

Rather than a society in which people of low income have to scrape together enough money to buy a car, I want to live in a city where all people of all income brackets choose public transit as the most practical mode of transportation. Public transit strengthens our society and our environment, and saves money. It makes it possible for our low-income neighbors to make it to work, school, the grocery store, etc. while also reducing our need for fossil fuels, slowing climate change. I plan to support Eau Claire Transit in any way I can. Click <a href="http://ecbus.org">here</a> for more information on the Eau Claire transit system.

#### Active transportation

As a fair-weather bicyclist, I am eager to improve Eau Claire’s bicycle infrastructure so that it is safer and more enjoyable for Eau Claire residents and visitors to get where they need to go or to just enjoy the fresh air and some exercise. I would like to see complete streets in Eau Claire, so that all people -- pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers -- have access to the local businesses they need and feel safe getting there. 

#### Food access

Food insecurity is a prevailing problem in Eau Claire and the United States as a whole. With 1 in 5 children in the Eau Claire Area School District food insecure, we have a lot to work on. I believe it is the responsibility of the city, county, state, and national government as well as the individual, private sector, and non-profit sector to ensure that all of our neighbors have enough food to feed their families. As a City Councilwoman, I plan to work on more initiatives like Market Match, a city-sponsored program which doubles the purchasing power for FoodShare recipients at the Eau Claire Downtown Farmers Market <a href="http://ecmarketmatch.wordpress.com">(Learn more about Market Match)</a>. It is important to me that we are not making just any food available for our low-income neighbors, but the best food--food that is fresh, healthy, and locally grown. 

#### Living wage

I have been an advocate for a living wage on the steering committee for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/15nownorthwestwisconsin/">15 Now Northwest Wisconsin</a>, a local group that has recently joined the national movement to increase the minimum wage to $15/hour. A full time worker should never be living below the poverty line. As a City Councilwoman I will continue to advocate on a national level for a living wage. But I truly believe that a national movement starts right here at home. As a tax-paying citizen of this city, I want my city employees to be paid a living wage. And as a City Councilwoman I would support a living wage ordinance that would ensure all full-time, part-time, and contracted employees of the city are paid a fair, livable wage. 


#### Small business

I just can’t get enough of Eau Claire’s small, locally owned businesses. Not only do they bring a unique culture to our city, they enhance our local economy. According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2013/04/03/investing-in-local-food-businesses-for-community-health-and-wealth/#5179f8fb6114">Forbes</a>, more than a dozen studies have shown that every dollar spent at a locally owned business generates two-to-four times the economic impact of a dollar spent on an equivalent non-local business. The Eau Claire City Council has done a phenomenal job supporting our local downtown businesses, and when I’m elected as a City Councilwoman, I will back efforts to keep the momentum going.

#### Historic neighborhoods

Eau Claire’s historic neighborhoods are a real treasure to our community. Not only do they preserve Eau Claire’s heritage, they provide housing for a large diversity of Eau Claire residents, including young professionals, families, and UW-Eau Claire students. I am interested in preserving the rich diversity of our historic neighborhoods by supporting actions by the city that foster a better relationship between renters, landlords, and homeowners. One way this could be accomplished is by simultaneously addressing the culture of binge drinking among students and young renters and increasing expectation and accountability of landlords. 

#### Parks and health

Urban green space does so much good for our physical, mental, and emotional health. Parks offer space to exercise, appreciate nature, relax, participate in community events, and spend quality time with your family and friends. A stronger parks system builds a stronger community. That’s why as a City Councilwoman, I would support initiatives to expand our parks and trails system in Eau Claire.
