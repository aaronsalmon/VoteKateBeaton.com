### I <3 Eau Claire

<img src="/img/Eau_Claire_outline.png" class="pull-right img-right">I love Eau Claire. I fell in love with Eau Claire when I arrived to attend the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and I canâ€™t imagine calling any other place home. Not only does Eau Claire have so much going for it including Phoenix Park, the historic Downtown area, and the rich music scene, there are so many more amazing things to come including the Confluence Project and the year round public market. 

As great as Eau Claire is, I want to help make it even better. There are some things that we are doing as a community that I think we could do better and there are some serious issues we need to start to address. 

Please see my list of issues and ideas below. 


### Issues
